---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

We didn't add any new data structures.

>> A2: What is the maximum size of a file supported by the inode
>> structure?  Show your work.

The size of an individual inode is defined by BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE, which make it 
512 bytes long. There are 125 sectors available for files (from DIRECT_CNT +
INDIRECT_CNT + DBL_INDIRECT_CNT). This means that a file can be a maximum size 
of about 64 KB.

---- DIRECTORIES and SUBDIRECTORIES ----

>> A3: How do you prevent races on directory entries?  For example,
>> only one of two simultaneous attempts to remove a single file
>> should succeed, as should only one of two simultaneous attempts to
>> create a file with the same name, and so on.

A lock is required to modify an inode on directory removal. This technique
mitigates the risk of encountering race conditions. This same locking technique 
is used for directory creation as well.

>> A4: Does your implementation allow a directory to be removed if it

>> file system operations?  If not, how do you prevent it?

Our implementation checks that the directory to be removed is not the current
working directory by checking the return value of inode_open_cnt(<this inode>).
In a similar way, we check to make sure that we are not removing a directory that
is otherwise in use.


			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future quarters or the remaining projects?

>> Any other comments?
